Interacting with them I realised that all my education hadn’t equipped me to deal with any of it & this required a whole other skill set. This realisation hit me hard. Being a survivor myself I was highly aware of the impact of risk factors and protective factors that existed within the system. This pushed me to further enhance my training by enrolling in courses, taking intensive supervision, and adding to my trauma therapy skill set. I went on to work with many different organizations and understood that while so many people could identify the prevalence and impact of trauma, there was no concrete intervention that could help mitigate this impact. There were so many gaps in the level of understanding and care. There were adults struggling with trauma themselves, trying to raise children who were struggling too. They say that it takes a village, and from my standpoint, that village was completely disconnected. This yearning for creating a network of compassion, connection, care, equipped with knowledge and expertise sowed the seed for the birth of I Am Wellbeing."})})}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"",children:[e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:p,alt:"img",effect:"blur",className:"max-w-sm h-auto ",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:"aboutus-images/worker1-small.png"})}),e.jsx("h6",{className:"text-center bg-cover bg-repeat-round font-bold",style:{backgroundImage:`url(${f})`},children:"Akanksha Chandele, Director"})]})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"our-team mt-10",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"bg-cover bg-no-repeat bg-bottom h-32 flex items-center  px-5 pt-10 pb-16 max-lg:pb-10",style:{backgroundImage:`url(${o})`},children:e.jsx("h1",{className:"text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-bold mb-5",children:"Core Team"})}),e.jsx("div",{className:"team-container flex flex-wrap justify-center items-center max-w-[70rem] m-auto mt-10 -mb-6 min-h-screen",children:m.map(a=>e.jsx("div",{className:"team-card flex-[0_0 49%] xs:flex-[0_0 48%] sm:flex-[0_0 31%] min-h-[300px] flex flex-col items-center justify-center cursor-pointer relative mr-4 mb-6",onClick:()=>{c(a),i(!0)},children:e.jsxs("div",{className:"relative w-[300px] h-[300px]",children:[e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:a.imgSrc,alt:"team",className:"w-full h-full object-cover rounded-full",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:`home-images/${a.smallImgSrc}`})}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"details absolute bottom-0 w-full text-center py-2",children:[e.jsx("h6",{className:"font-bold uppercase text-lg text-black",children:a.name}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text text-gray-700 font-[500] text-md",children:a.designation})]})]})},a.name))})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"our-consultant mt-10",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"bg-cover bg-no-repeat bg-bottom h-32 flex items-center  px-5 pt-10 pb-16 max-lg:pb-10",style:{backgroundImage:`url(${o})`},children:e.jsx("h1",{className:"text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-bold mb-5",children:"Our Consultants"})}),e.jsx("div",{className:"team-container grid xs:grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 max-w-5xl m-auto gap-6 mt-10",children:g.map((a,d)=>e.jsxs("div",{className:"min-h-[300px] flex flex-col items-center m-auto cursor-pointer relative",children:[e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:a.imgSrc,alt:"team",className:" object-cover relative",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:`home-images/${a.smallImgSrc}`})}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"details  details  w-full absolute lg:bottom-14 sm:bottom-14 bottom-10",children:[e.jsx("h6",{className:"font-bold text-black uppercase text-lg text-center",children:a.name}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text text-gray-800 font-[500] text-lg text-center",children:a.designation})]})]},d))})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"annual-reports mt-14",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"text-4xl md:text-6xl text-white font-bold relative h-[80px] lg:h-[120px]",style:{backgroundColor:"#029390",backgroundImage:`url(${x})`,backgroundSize:"100% auto",backgroundRepeat:"repeat-x",backgroundPosition:"bottom left"},children:e.jsx("h1",{className:"absolute  top-4 lg:top-5 left-2 lg:text-5xl text-3xl lg:mt-0 font-semibold",children:"Annual Reports"})}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"annual-container  grid xs:grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 md:max-w-5xl w-[90%] m-auto gap-8 mt-10",children:[e.jsx("a",{href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O2lsC6jPYwwu_HR-qmm7_vgxRpKYNBDu/view?usp=sharing&embedded=true",target:"_blank",className:"cursor-pointer",children:e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:L,alt:"annualreport1",effect:"blur",className:"sm:w-[300px]",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:"aboutus-images/annualreport1-small.png"})})}),e.jsx("a",{href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ayDznPPVbfQtQ2G802D8d-PEy6xQWzy/view?usp=sharing&embedded=true",target:"_blank",className:"cursor-pointer",children:e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:C,alt:"annualreport2",effect:"blur",className:"sm:w-[300px]",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:"aboutus-images/annualreport2-small.png"})})}),e.jsx("a",{href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/11q4HwENy1-IsLeVGLVxrQn1hzyK_pnW3/view?usp=sharing&embedded=true",target:"_blank",className:"cursor-pointer",children:e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:R,alt:"annualreport3",effect:"blur",className:"sm:w-[300px]",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:"aboutus-images/annualreport3-small.png"})})}),e.jsx("a",{href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sHhcyxUHjhX5kjdfWZ4ufhymyDqSBjap/view?usp=sharing&embedded=true",target:"_blank",className:"cursor-pointer",children:e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:D,alt:"annualreport4",effect:"blur",className:"sm:w-[300px]",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:"aboutus-images/annualreport4-small.jpeg"})})})]})]})]})})};export{E as default};
