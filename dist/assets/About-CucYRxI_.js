Interacting with them I realised that all my education hadn’t equipped me to deal with any of it & this required a whole other skill set. This realisation hit me hard. Being a survivor myself I was highly aware of the impact of risk factors and protective factors that existed within the system. This pushed me to further enhance my training by enrolling in courses, taking intensive supervision, and adding to my trauma therapy skill set. I went on to work with many different organizations and understood that while so many people could identify the prevalence and impact of trauma, there was no concrete intervention that could help mitigate this impact. There were so many gaps in the level of understanding and care. There were adults struggling with trauma themselves, trying to raise children who were struggling too. They say that it takes a village, and from my standpoint, that village was completely disconnected. This yearning for creating a network of compassion, connection, care, equipped with knowledge and expertise sowed the seed for the birth of I Am Wellbeing."})})}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"",children:[e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:p,alt:"img",effect:"blur",className:"max-w-sm h-auto ",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:"aboutus-images/worker1-small.png"})}),e.jsx("h6",{className:"text-center bg-cover bg-repeat-round font-bold",style:{backgroundImage:`url(${f})`},children:"Akanksha Chandele, Director"})]})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"our-team mt-10",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"text-4xl md:text-6xl text-white font-bold relative p-1 h-[80px] lg:h-[120px]",style:{backgroundColor:"#029390",backgroundImage:`url(${i})`,backgroundSize:"100% auto",backgroundRepeat:"repeat-x",backgroundPosition:"bottom left"},children:e.jsx("h1",{className:"absolute  top-4 lg:top-5 left-2",children:"Core Team"})}),e.jsx("div",{className:"team-container grid xs:grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-6   md:grid-cols-3 max-w-3xl m-auto  mt-10",children:m.map(a=>e.jsxs("div",{className:"team-card w-[100%] min-h-[300px] flex flex-col items-center   m-auto cursor-pointer relative",onClick:()=>{c(a),o(!0)},children:[e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:a.imgSrc,alt:"team",className:"w-full h-[200px] relative",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:`home-images/${a.smallImgSrc}`})}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"details  w-full text-center absolute lg:bottom-14 sm:bottom-14 bottom-10",children:[e.jsx("h6",{className:"font-bold uppercase text-lg ",children:a.name}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text text-gray-600 font-[500] text-md  ",children:a.designation})]})]},a.name))})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"our-consultant mt-10",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"text-4xl md:text-6xl text-white font-bold relative h-[80px] lg:h-[120px]",style:{backgroundColor:"#029390",backgroundImage:`url(${i})`,backgroundSize:"100% auto",backgroundRepeat:"repeat-x",backgroundPosition:"bottom left"},children:e.jsx("h1",{className:"absolute  top-4 lg:top-5 left-2",children:"Our Consultants"})}),e.jsx("div",{className:"team-container grid xs:grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 max-w-5xl m-auto gap-6 mt-10",children:d.map((a,g)=>e.jsxs("div",{className:"min-h-[300px] flex flex-col items-center m-auto cursor-pointer relative",children:[e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:a.imgSrc,alt:"team",className:" object-cover relative",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:`home-images/${a.smallImgSrc}`})}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"details  details  w-full absolute lg:bottom-14 sm:bottom-14 bottom-10",children:[e.jsx("h6",{className:"font-bold text-black uppercase text-lg text-center",children:a.name}),e.jsx("p",{className:"text text-gray-800 font-[500] text-lg text-center",children:a.designation})]})]},g))})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"annual-reports mt-14",children:[e.jsx("div",{className:"text-4xl md:text-6xl text-white font-bold relative h-[80px] lg:h-[120px]",style:{backgroundColor:"#029390",backgroundImage:`url(${i})`,backgroundSize:"100% auto",backgroundRepeat:"repeat-x",backgroundPosition:"bottom left"},children:e.jsx("h1",{className:"absolute  top-4 lg:top-5 left-2",children:"Annual Reports"})}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"annual-container  grid xs:grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 md:max-w-5xl w-[90%] m-auto gap-8 mt-10",children:[e.jsx("a",{href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O2lsC6jPYwwu_HR-qmm7_vgxRpKYNBDu/view?usp=sharing&embedded=true",target:"_blank",className:"cursor-pointer",children:e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:A,alt:"annualreport1",effect:"blur",className:"sm:w-[300px]",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:"aboutus-images/annualreport1-small.png"})})}),e.jsx("a",{href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ayDznPPVbfQtQ2G802D8d-PEy6xQWzy/view?usp=sharing&embedded=true",target:"_blank",className:"cursor-pointer",children:e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:C,alt:"annualreport2",effect:"blur",className:"sm:w-[300px]",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:"aboutus-images/annualreport2-small.png"})})}),e.jsx("a",{href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/11q4HwENy1-IsLeVGLVxrQn1hzyK_pnW3/view?usp=sharing&embedded=true",target:"_blank",className:"cursor-pointer",children:e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:L,alt:"annualreport3",effect:"blur",className:"sm:w-[300px]",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:"aboutus-images/annualreport3-small.png"})})}),e.jsx("a",{href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sHhcyxUHjhX5kjdfWZ4ufhymyDqSBjap/view?usp=sharing&embedded=true",target:"_blank",className:"cursor-pointer",children:e.jsx(t.LazyLoadImage,{src:R,alt:"annualreport4",effect:"blur",className:"sm:w-[300px]",placeholder:e.jsx(s,{imgUrl:"aboutus-images/annualreport4-small.jpeg"})})})]})]})]})})};export{W as default};
