        <p>
          Trauma is the most unaddressed and unseen epidemic in todayâ€™s time.
          Seven out of ten children in India experience some form of adversity
          at an early age. If left unaddressed, these painful experiences can
          haunt them for the rest of their lives, deeply impacting their mental,
          emotional, and physical wellbeing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I Am Wellbeing (Nairatmya Foundation) is a mental health not-for-
          profit organization dedicated to supporting such young lives
          struggling with adverse childhood experiences and building an
          ecosystem of trusted, available, trained adults. We believe in the
          power of compassion, connection, and care to develop a healthy and
          happy nation.

        <h2 className='title'>Rationale</h2>
        <p>
          While the last decade has highlighted the significant need for mental
          health interventions, it has also exposed the scarcity of trained
          professionals compared to the staggeringly high number of people in
          need of mental health care and support in India. With each passing day
          we get to witness a new statistic or data related to increasingly high
          number of deaths by suicide, depression rate, severe mental health and
          physical health concerns like chronic illnesses, heart problems, and
          autoimmune diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key to mitigating the impact of the perpetually increasing
          wellbeing concerns in our country is to look beyond the presenting
          symptoms of an individual and work towards the root cause through a
          holistic and trauma- informed outlook.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strive to fulfill this unmet need of quality mental health care by
          building the capacity of professionals towards adapting a trauma-
          informed approach that is inclusive, contextualised, and
          de-stigmatising. To bring this shift in managing mental health
          concerns, we have designed a 6 months long coursework on trauma-
          informed care practices. Experts from the field will support the
          participants to build a trauma-informed lens for intervention
          planning.
        </p>

        <p>
          The course will create an understanding of evidence-based holistic
          tools used to process deep-rooted trauma.

        <h2 className='title'>Course Activities & Duration</h2>
        <p>
          The course will encompass various activities like learning sessions,
          group discussions, assignments, case conceptualisation, roleplays &
          supervision. There are a total of six modules to be covered over a
          period of two months. Upon completion of each module, the participants
          will submit graded assignments. The end of the theory sessions will
          embark on the beginning of four months of trauma-informed supervision
          with experts from the field. As the supervision commences,
          participants will attend a viva and submit case studies. The intensive
          process is designed to ensure the learning and application of trauma-
          informed care practices successfully.
